Description:

Spine animator is component which animates your skeleton's spine bones accordingly to movement.
It's simulating real animal-like spine movement without any need of additional animating or coding.
This component will make your animations look much more real without wasting a lot of time
for making decent animations of walking / running to sides by your creatures and without
spending a lot of money for animator to create this animations.
Another benefit from this procedural animating is that all movement of bones is continious, 
so it feels more real if your creature is rotating, stopping it etc.

Main features:
- Includes interactive demo scenes
- Includes full source code
- Easy setup and incredible effect
- Fully cooperating with keyframed animations
- Not needed any coding
- Visual friendly inspector window with helpful features
- Highly customizable
- Very high performance
- Blending with original animation


Known issues:
- When your model is very long it can disappear sometimes, that's caused by skinned mesh render which's bounding box is going out of sight
in next versions there will be added option to adjust bounds dynamically by component.
- Using limiting angle with straightening can sometimes cause rapid rotations, it's thing to polish in next versions
- Depends on your skeleton, when you jump or so, skeleton segments can rotate in opposite direction, you can toggle 'Inversed Vertical Rotation'
as solution for now, but in next version all will be adjusted automatically without need for this toggle
- Connecting tail using spine animator in the same time using spine animator on spine bones can be sometimes problematic, depends on your skeleton
it can be too hard, then I recommend using my other package "Tail Animator" which gives good result without any additional tweaks
